# North Star

North Star is a Work Organization Website for NJIT students. It allows students to upload files and or their necessary homework and we will filter it by assigning different priorities to send workload. We will do so by checking the length of the work, the date it was assigned, the date it will be due, and any outside factors that may affect one's capabilities to finish their assignments.
